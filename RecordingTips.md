# Recording Tips

* Video - Please ensure all video is landscape. If you’re using a phone, either mount it on a tripod or just a solid surface. Avoid holding the phone ‘selfie style’ as it will be wobbly. Please be looking directly into the camera or just below it eg at a script.
* When setting up, be aware of lighting. A room where you can control the lighting is ideal. Don’t have your back to a window or any overpowering light source that will make you a silhouette. Having interesting things or shapes in the background is absolutely fine though.
* Audio – Be aware of the background noises like traffic, TV, your phone or even pets! A room with some soft furnishing is great for noise dampening.
* Shoot for the edit – When you start recording, please wait 3-5 seconds before you start talking. This really helps with the editing process. Do this at the end as well.
