# Recording Tips

* Video — Please ensure all video is landscape. If you’re using a phone, either mount it on a tripod or just a solid surface. Avoid holding the phone ‘selfie style’ as it will be wobbly. Please be looking directly into the camera or just below it eg. at a script.
* When setting up, be aware of lighting. A room where you can control the lighting is ideal. Don’t have your back to a window or any overpowering light source that will make you a silhouette. Having interesting things or shapes in the background is absolutely fine though.
* Audio — Be aware of the background noises like traffic, TV, your phone or even pets! A room with some soft furnishing is great for noise dampening.
* Shoot for the edit — When you start recording, please wait 3-5 seconds before you start talking. This really helps with the editing process. Do this at the end as well.

### StreamYard [Multi User but tends to more live videos rather than pre-recording for edits]

'Dan and Geige, thought there should be a streaming tool that anyone could use – a tool that was fun instead of stressful – a tool that was simple, but powerful enough to create engaging content. They wanted people who weren’t techy, or who simply didn’t want to deal with the hassle of streaming, to still go live, share their stories, and grow their own communities'
